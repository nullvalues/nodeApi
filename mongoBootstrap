You'll need to create a mongo database called testnode

testnode  0.000GB
> use testnode
switched to db testnode

You'll need to create a collection called myCollection
> show collections
myCollection

You'll need to add a couple of documents that look a lot like this
> db.myCollection.find({}).pretty()
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5f593ae99b22f4f49d94c6ad"), "x" : 1 }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5f59645df36161c9b729d96c"), "x" : 202 }
